## 👋 About Me
Hi, my name is Daniel. Welcome to my technical portfolio. I am a Cloud Security Practitioner building hands-on experience in securing cloud infrastructure, managing identity (IAM), and automating incident response.

This repository documents my journey from general cloud concepts to specialized security engineering. My goal is to demonstrate practical proficiency in **AWS** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** through documented labs and real-world scenarios.
